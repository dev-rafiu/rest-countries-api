## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In building this project I learned how to fetch data from an API when filtering and searching, I would normally achieve this functionality easier in React.js but I had decided to use vanilla JS and and learn while building.

The second thing I have to learn for the first in plain vanilla JS is how to navigate to an HTML page dynamically and show diffrent content by using the "window.location" property.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

### Continued development

I would like to keep building more project using vanilla JS to understand more
